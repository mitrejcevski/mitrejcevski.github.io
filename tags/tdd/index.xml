      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the following piece of code:
fun search(query: String): List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; { val allItems: List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; = ExternalSystem.fetchAllItems() val filtered = allItems.filter { it.contains(query) } val reordered = filtered.sortedWith(object : Comparator&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; { override fun compare(lhs: String, rhs: String): Int { if (lhs == query) { return -1 } else if (rhs == query) { return 0 } return lhs.compareTo(rhs) } }) return reordered } From a behavioral point of view, this code has no problems.</description>

      <description>A quick overview in our industry I&amp;rsquo;m in the IT industry, particularly in Android for roughly 10 years now, and one thing I can tell with great confidence is that this industry moves incredibly fast.
