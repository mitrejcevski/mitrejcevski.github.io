      <description>Suppose we have the following interface:
interface Validator { fun validate(query: String): Boolean } and suppose it&amp;rsquo;s being used as a collaborator in a few places:
class FindItems( val validator: Validator, val repository: Repository ) { fun search(keyword: String) { if (validator.validate(keyword)) { repository.findItemsContaining(keyword) } } } class DeleteItems( val validator: Validator, val repository: Repository ) { fun deleteMatches(value: String) { if (validator.validate(value)) { repository.deleteItemsMatching(value) } } } Of course, we would have some tests for these functionalities, which might look something like this respectively:</description>

      <description>⚠️ Disclaimer Any kinds of diagrams have nothing to do with TDD at all. We find the diagrams handy when we want to visualize, explain, teach, or learn something. That&amp;rsquo;s all. It&amp;rsquo;s a drawing on a sheet of paper that we throw afterward. We don&amp;rsquo;t keep the diagrams around; we don&amp;rsquo;t maintain them. That&amp;rsquo;d be a massive waste of time.
Sequence Diagram Example
 What&amp;rsquo;s this Sequence Diagram thingy? As mentioned in the disclaimer, the sequence diagram is a tool we can use to visualize an approximation of where we want to go when working on the unit in question.</description>

      <description>A quick overview in our industry I&amp;rsquo;m in the IT industry, particularly in Android for roughly 10 years now, and one thing I can tell with great confidence is that this industry moves incredibly fast. Looking back all these years, it&amp;rsquo;s been an extraordinary evolution of the OS itself, as well as the community around it. However, sometimes it feels like our industry lacks a lot of good practices and discipline in the development process, a lack of professionalism.</description>
